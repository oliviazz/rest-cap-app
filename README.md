# Restaurant Capacity Tracker 
## Senior Research Project 2015-2016

Restaurant Query Web application that provides estimates of real-time capacity using data from Yelp, OpenTable, and Google Maps. 
Functionality to make reservations, view step-by-step directions, and submit capacity reports is also created.

long waiting times, slow service, and other effects of overcapacity.
